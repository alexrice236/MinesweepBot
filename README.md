# MinesweepBot
MinesweepBot is an AM14U3 base chassis that utilizes two SRX Magnetic Encoders (on the magnetic gearbox shaft) and a Kauai Labs navX Gyroscope to autonomously drive over an area when given length and width dimensions. While driving, a custom Arduino metal detector will register changes in the magnetic field up to a range of 15cm. If the inductance of the coil changes enough, the Arduino will send digital output to a DIO port on the roboRIO robot controller. When the robot receives this digital input, it will autonomously stop and mark the area where metal was found. This bot is designed for use by surface/ground troops in order to clear explosive ordnance while minimizing the risk to human life. The metal detector prototype and parts of the Arduino code are from a design by Instructables user “rgco,” but everything else in the following folders is the product of my work and my work only.
